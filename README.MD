This page contains the source code for Vocabulate, the software used for:

Vine, V., Boyd, R. L., & Pennebaker, J. W. (2020). Natural emotion vocabularies as windows on distress and well-being. Nature Communications, 11(1), 4525. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18349-0

Note that the software can be compiled from the code on this page, or you can download and run the executable for the program from the [software's website](https://www.ryanboyd.io/software/vocabulate/). Note that this software is no longer in active development, although we plan to make the software slightly more obvious in the near future (e.g., with an instructional YouTube video). The functionality of Vocabulate has been folder into some soon-to-be-released software: [BUTTER](https://www.butter.tools/).
